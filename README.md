# ForestGEO Site Data

## About this repository
This public repository is a portal for site data for [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) sites.
It was initiated in July 2017 with data from [Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12712/abstract), adding sites that joined the network since that publication.
