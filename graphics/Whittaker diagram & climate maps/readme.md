The R script in this folder uses the [plotbiomes R package](https://valentinitnelav.github.io/plotbiomes/) to create a Whittaker diagram and climate (MAT, MAP) maps overlain with ForestGEO sites.

ForestGEO site coordinates and climate data (when available) were drawn from [ForestGEO_site_data.csv](basic site data/ForestGEO_site_data.csv).

The climate maps are based on WorldClim data, which was also used to fill missing climate data.
